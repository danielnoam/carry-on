# Android installs an update only over an app signed with the same key, so the
# key has to be the same one every time: it comes from two repository secrets,
# ANDROID_KEYSTORE_B64 (the .jks, base64) and ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD. The
# key alias is "carryon" and its password is the store's.
#
# Without the secrets it still signs — with a throwaway key made on the spot,
# so the APK installs and can be tried — and reports signed=false, which is
# what keeps the workflow from publishing it as a release. A published
# throwaway-signed APK would be the one every later update refuses to install
# over.

# Notes

Why things are the way they are, newest first. Each entry starts with a
bold title and its version so a search finds it.

- **Started from LifeLog (0.1.0).** The build tooling (tools/build-www.js,
  android-version.js, sign-apk.sh, ios-project.js and both workflows) and
  `src/platform.js`'s app-vs-browser handling come from
  danielnoam/lifelog at 0.227.0, trimmed of LifeLog-only parts (widgets,
  QR scanner, APK self-update, phone backup). Its NOTES.md has the history
  behind each of them; search there before "fixing" something that looks
  arbitrary in those files.
- **No server for the phone app (0.1.0).** `CarryOn.platform.fetchText`
  uses CapacitorHttp in the app, which is native networking and not
  subject to CORS; LifeLog proved this in its 0.215.0. In a browser it
  falls back to `fetch`, which CORS blocks for most sites: the web copy
  can read saved pages but can't save new ones until a worker or an
  extension exists. See docs/PROPOSAL.md.
- **CapacitorHttp is called directly, not via the global fetch patch
  (0.1.0).** `CapacitorHttp.enabled` in capacitor.config.json would move
  every fetch in the app, including loading its own files, onto the native
  stack. LifeLog made the same call for the same reason.
- **Images are previews plus links (0.1.0).** Daniel's choice, matching
  how videos are handled: a ~480 px preview on disk, the full image's URL
  kept. Links-only was considered and set aside as the default because on
  a plane a map or diagram becomes an empty box; it stays as a setting.
- **Fonts are bundled, Latin subset (0.1.0).** Source Serif 4 and
  Instrument Sans from Google Fonts, OFL. Other scripts fall back to the
  system font through unicode-range, so Hebrew or Arabic pages still read
  well without shipping megabytes of glyphs.
- **Readability is vendored at 0.6.0 (0.1.0).** One file, Apache-2.0, the
  same parser Firefox Reader View uses. Vendored rather than installed to
  keep the no-build rule.

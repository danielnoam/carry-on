# Notes

Why things are the way they are, newest first. Each entry starts with a
bold title and its version so a search finds it.

- **The app updates itself, as LifeLog does (0.2.0).** On launch the app
  asks GitHub for the latest `app-v*` release; if it's newer, "Update"
  downloads that tag's CarryOn.apk into the cache with
  `Filesystem.downloadFile` and opens Android's installer through
  capawesome's FileOpener. The manifest needs `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES`
  (tools/android-manifest.js) or Android refuses the hand-off. It only
  installs over a build signed with the same key, which is why the
  workflow publishes nothing without the `carryon` keystore. LifeLog's
  NOTES.md (0.179.0) has the history, including why downloadFile is used
  despite being deprecated.

- **The reader's iframe keeps allow-same-origin (0.2.0).** Without
  `allow-scripts` nothing in the page can run, so same-origin only lets
  src/reader.js reach in: copy the theme tokens onto it, catch taps on
  links (an in-page `#ref` scrolls, anything else opens in the phone's
  browser via AppLauncher; a link must never navigate the iframe), and
  swap previews for full images. The page's own CSP is `default-src
  'none'` plus images, the app's stylesheets and fonts. The two are only
  dangerous together; test/save.test.js fails if `allow-scripts` appears.
- **Cleaning is an allowlist that rebuilds the page (0.2.0).** src/save.js
  never copies the fetched DOM: it creates each kept element afresh with
  only the attributes named in `ATTRS`, so an `on*` handler, `style`,
  `srcdoc` or a `javascript:` link can't come through by being forgotten.
  `style` goes entirely (along with anything it hid), which is why
  Wikipedia infoboxes lose their colours.
- **Wikimedia thumbnails at 500 and 1280 px, not 480 (0.2.0).** Wikimedia
  pre-renders and caches a fixed set of widths and rate-limits tools that
  ask for others, so the preview is the 500 px step and the full image the
  1280 px step, capped at the file's own width.
- **Page titles prefer og:title or the page's one h1 (0.2.0).**
  Readability keeps "Headline | Site" for short headlines.
- **Saved pages in a browser go to IndexedDB, images stay links (0.2.0).**
  The web copy can save Wikipedia (its API allows CORS) but has no folder
  for images; its cards say "Text offline · images online".

- **Started from LifeLog (0.1.0).** The build tooling (tools/build-www.js,
  android-version.js, sign-apk.sh, ios-project.js and both workflows) and
  `src/platform.js`'s app-vs-browser handling come from
  danielnoam/lifelog at 0.227.0, trimmed of LifeLog-only parts (widgets,
  QR scanner, phone backup). Its NOTES.md has the history
  behind each of them; search there before "fixing" something that looks
  arbitrary in those files.
- **No server for the phone app (0.1.0).** `CarryOn.platform.fetchText`
  uses CapacitorHttp in the app, which is native networking and not
  subject to CORS; LifeLog proved this in its 0.215.0. In a browser it
  falls back to `fetch`, which CORS blocks for most sites: the web copy
  can read saved pages but can't save new ones until a worker or an
  extension exists. See docs/PROPOSAL.md.
- **CapacitorHttp is called directly, not via the global fetch patch
  (0.1.0).** `CapacitorHttp.enabled` in capacitor.config.json would move
  every fetch in the app, including loading its own files, onto the native
  stack. LifeLog made the same call for the same reason.
- **Images are previews plus links (0.1.0).** Daniel's choice, matching
  how videos are handled: a ~480 px preview on disk, the full image's URL
  kept. Links-only was considered and set aside as the default because on
  a plane a map or diagram becomes an empty box; it stays as a setting.
- **Fonts are bundled, Latin subset (0.1.0).** Source Serif 4 and
  Instrument Sans from Google Fonts, OFL. Other scripts fall back to the
  system font through unicode-range, so Hebrew or Arabic pages still read
  well without shipping megabytes of glyphs.
- **Readability is vendored at 0.6.0 (0.1.0).** One file, Apache-2.0, the
  same parser Firefox Reader View uses. Vendored rather than installed to
  keep the no-build rule.
